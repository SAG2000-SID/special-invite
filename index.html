Create a single-page Valentine proposal website using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Requirements:

1. The page should display:
   - A cute romantic heading: “Will you be my Valentine? ❤️”
   - Two buttons: "Yes 💖" and "No 😢"

2. Styling:
   - Soft pink background gradient
   - Centered content (both vertically and horizontally)
   - Rounded buttons with smooth hover effects
   - Cute, romantic aesthetic (Google font like Poppins or Comic Neue)
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

3. "No" Button Behavior:
   - When the mouse moves near the "No" button, it should move to a random position on the screen.
   - It should be very hard to click.
   - If the user somehow clicks it, show a playful alert message randomly chosen from:
        - "Really? 😭"
        - "Wrong answer!"
        - "Try again 😌"
        - "That’s illegal 🚫"
        - "You sure about that? 🤨"
   - Do NOT allow the page to change if "No" is clicked.

4. "Yes" Button Behavior:
   - When clicked:
        - Fade out the current content smoothly.
        - Show a new centered message:
            "YAYYYY!!! 💕 I love you!!"
        - Display a Valentine-themed GIF (use a placeholder like:
            https://media.giphy.com/media/MDJ9IbxxvDUQM/giphy.gif
          )
        - Add floating heart animations in the background.

5. Add subtle animations:
   - Floating hearts continuously moving upward.
   - Smooth transitions for button movement.
   - Slight bounce effect on the "Yes" button on hover.

6. Keep all code in one file (single HTML file with embedded CSS and JS).

7. Make the code clean, readable, and well-commented.

Output:
Return the complete HTML code only.
