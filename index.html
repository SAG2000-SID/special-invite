Create a single-page Valentine proposal website using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Requirements:

1. Page Content:
   - Centered romantic heading: “Will you be my Valentine? ❤️”
   - Two buttons below it:
        - "Yes 💖"
        - "No 😢"

2. Design:
   - Soft pink romantic gradient background
   - Content centered vertically and horizontally
   - Use a romantic Google Font (like Poppins)
   - Rounded buttons with smooth hover animations
   - Responsive for mobile and desktop
   - Clean, modern, cute aesthetic

3. "No" Button Behavior:
   - When the cursor moves near the "No" button, it should jump to a random position within the viewport.
   - Make it difficult to click.
   - Ensure it always stays inside the visible screen.
   - If it is clicked, show a random playful alert from:
        - "Really? 😭"
        - "Wrong answer!"
        - "Try again 😌"
        - "That’s illegal 🚫"
        - "You sure about that? 🤨"
   - Do NOT allow navigation or page change when "No" is clicked.

4. "Yes" Button Behavior:
   - On click:
        - Smooth fade-out animation of current content
        - Show new centered message:
              "YAYYYY!!! 💕 I love you!!"
        - Display this GIF:
              https://media.giphy.com/media/MDJ9IbxxvDUQM/giphy.gif
        - Add floating animated hearts in the background

5. Animations:
   - Floating hearts continuously rising upward
   - Slight bounce effect on "Yes" button hover
   - Smooth transitions for button movement and fade effects

6. Technical:
   - Everything must be in ONE single HTML file
   - Embed CSS and JavaScript inside the file
   - Code must be clean, readable, and well-commented

Output:
Return ONLY the complete HTML code.
